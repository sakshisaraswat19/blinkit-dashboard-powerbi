# Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

# Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built for Blinkit, focusing on analyzing sales performance, customer preferences, and outlet-level trends. The goal of this dashboard is to convert raw transactional data into actionable business insights that help stakeholders understand what drives sales, how outlets perform, and where optimization is possible.
The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing trends across product categories, outlet characteristics, and customer behavior.

# Business Objective
Blinkit operates across multiple outlet types, sizes, and locations, making it critical to understand which combinations generate higher revenue and customer satisfaction. This dashboard aims to:
- Monitor overall sales performance at a glance
- Identify high-performing product categories and outlet types
- Analyze how outlet characteristics (size, location, age) impact sales
- Support strategic decisions such as inventory planning, outlet expansion, and product placement

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  1. Total Sales
   This KPI represents the overall revenue generated from all item sales across Blinkit outlets. It provides a high-level view of business performance and serves      as the primary metric for evaluating growth and success.

  2. Average Sales
   Average Sales shows the mean sales value per transaction, helping assess customer purchasing behavior. A higher average sale indicates effective cross-selling,     bundling, or premium product adoption.

  3. Number of Items Sold
   This metric captures the total quantity of items sold, offering insights into demand volume. It is especially useful for inventory planning and understanding       consumption patterns.

#  4. Average Rating
  Average Rating reflects customer satisfaction levels based on product ratings. This KPI connects sales performance with customer experience, highlighting whether   high sales align with positive feedback.

# Dashboard Visualizations & Analysis
 1. Total Sales by Fat Content
   This visualization compares sales across different fat content categories (Low Fat vs Regular). It helps understand changing consumer preferences and supports      healthier product positioning strategies.

 2. Total Sales by Item Type
   This chart highlights sales distribution across product categories, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify best-selling and underperforming items.

 3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
   This analysis breaks down how fat content preferences vary across outlets, revealing location-specific or outlet-specific buying patterns.

 4. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year
   This visualization shows sales trends based on outlet age, helping determine whether newer outlets outperform older ones or vice versa.

 5. Sales by Outlet Size
   Sales are analyzed across small, medium, and large outlets, offering insights into how physical scale impacts revenue generation.

 6. Sales by Outlet Location
   This chart compares sales performance across different outlet locations, enabling geographical performance analysis and regional strategy planning.

 7. All Metrics by Outlet Type
   This combined view analyzes total sales, number of items sold, and average ratings by outlet type, providing a holistic comparison of operational performance.

# Key Insights Generated
- Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue
- Outlet size and location significantly influence sales performance
- Customer preferences vary across outlets, especially for fat content
- Higher sales do not always correlate with higher customer ratings, highlighting areas for quality improvement

# Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations
- Data Cleaning & Transformation – Power Query
- DAX Measures – KPI calculations and aggregations

# Business Impact
This dashboard enables Blinkit stakeholders to quickly identify growth opportunities, optimize outlet performance, and enhance customer satisfaction. By centralizing KPIs and trends into a single interactive interface, decision-makers can reduce manual analysis time and focus on strategic actions that directly impact revenue and operational efficiency.
